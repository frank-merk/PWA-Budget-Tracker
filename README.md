## Technologies used

* PWA Framework
* Express for the server
* MongoDB & Mongoose for database
* Heroku for deployement
* Node for backend

## Description

This week's homework assignment was to create a budget tracker using a Progressive Web Application framework, including a manifest, service workers, database routing using Mongo, and offline functionality.
  
## Installation

To install, first make sure you have the dependencies (in this case express, bootstrap, mongoose, lite-server, compression, and dotenv for authentication ):

`npm install`

To run the application from the terminal, you will enter:

`npm start`

## Strategy

There was a good amount of starter code that served as a guide to building this application. Similarly, I was able to repurpose and rewrite previous manifests and service-workers to fit the specifics of this application. From there, I just needed to link Mongo Atlas and Heroku, as well as flesh out the back end functionality.

## Challenges

The most difficult section was reviewing general data-handling functionality to flesh out the backend, as well as getting the offline functionality to work on heroku. There were a few snags caused by permissions and incorrect links in my source files that were derailing a lot of my progress. Overall, I got the application to accept input offline and populate the database when the application came back online.
